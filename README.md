## 📦 Installation Guide (5 minutes)

### 🎯 Step 1: Clone the Project **IN VSCode**

1. Open **VSCode IDE**
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac)
3. Type "Git: Clone" and select it
4. Paste: `https://github.com/fperez2511/Azure-Devops-MCP-Server-For-VSCode.git`
5. Choose where to save it (remember this location!)
6. Click "Open" when VSCode asks

**You're now in the project folder in VSCode!** ✅

### 🔨 Step 2: Install Dependencies **IN VSCode**

1. In VSCode, press `` Ctrl+` `` to open the terminal

3. Type these commands:
   ```bash

**Alternative for Windows:** You can also double-click `install.bat` in the file explorer

### 🔑 Step 3: Get Your Azure DevOps Token

1. Open your browser and go to:
   ```
   https://dev.azure.com/YOUR-ORG-NAME/_usersSettings/tokens
   ```
   **Replace `YOUR-ORG-NAME` with your organization!**
   
   📍 **How to find your organization name:**
   - Look at your Azure DevOps URL
   - If it's `https://dev.azure.com/contoso/MyProject` → org is `contoso`
   - If it's `https://contoso.visualstudio.com/` → org is `contoso`

2. Click **"+ New Token"**
3. Name it: "VSCode MCP"
4. Expiration: 90 days (recommended)
5. Scopes: Click **"Custom defined"** then check:
   - ✅ Work Items (Read, Write & Manage)
   - ✅ Code (Read)
   - ✅ Build (Read & Execute)
   - ✅ Release (Read, Write & Execute)
   - ✅ Test Management (Read & Write)
   - ✅ Wiki (Read & Write)
6. Click **"Create"**
7. **COPY THE TOKEN NOW!** You won't see it again!

### 🔐 Step 4: Create .env File **IN THE RIGHT PLACE!**

#### ⚠️ CRITICAL: The .env file goes in the ROOT folder, NOT in src/ or dist/! ⚠️

**Option A: Using VSCode (Recommended)** 👈
1. In VSCode, right-click on the **root folder** (ADOMCPLocalServer)
2. Select "New File"
3. Name it exactly: `.env` (yes, starting with a dot!)
4. Paste this (replace with your values):
   ```
   AZURE_DEVOPS_ORG=your-organization-name
   AZURE_DEVOPS_PAT=your-token-from-step-3
   ```
5. Save with `Ctrl+S`

**Option B: Using setup.bat (Windows only)**
1. Double-click `setup.bat` in the root folder
2. Enter your organization name when asked
3. Paste your token when asked
4. It creates the .env file for you!

**Option C: Manual (if above doesn't work)**
1. Open Notepad
2. Paste:
   ```
   AZURE_DEVOPS_ORG=your-organization-name
   AZURE_DEVOPS_PAT=your-token-here
   ```
3. File → Save As
4. Navigate to the ADOMCPLocalServer folder (NOT src or dist!)
5. File name: `.env` (with the dot!)
6. Save as type: **All Files (*.*)**
7. Click Save

#### 📁 Correct File Structure:
```
ADOMCPLocalServer/
├── .env              ← YOUR .ENV FILE GOES HERE!
├── src/              ← NOT HERE!
├── dist/             ← NOT HERE!
├── package.json
├── install.bat
└── README.md
```

### 🔌 Step 5: Connect to VSCode

1. In VSCode, go to **File → Preferences → VSCode Settings**
2. In the left sidebar, find **"Tools & Integration"**
3. Click **"New MCP Server"**
4. **DELETE EVERYTHING** in the box and paste this:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "azure-devops-mcp-local": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["C:/PATH/TO/YOUR/ADOMCPLocalServer/dist/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

5. **IMPORTANT:** Replace `C:/PATH/TO/YOUR/` with your actual path!
   
   **How to find your path:**
   - In VSCode, look at the top of the window
   - Or right-click on any file → "Copy Path"
   - Use FORWARD SLASHES (/) not backslashes (\)
   
   **Examples:**
   - ✅ Windows: `"C:/Users/John/Projects/ADOMCPLocalServer/dist/index.js"`
   - ✅ Mac: `"/Users/john/Projects/ADOMCPLocalServer/dist/index.js"`
   - ❌ WRONG: `"C:\Users\John\..."` (backslashes don't work!)

6. Click outside the box to save

### 🔄 Step 6: Restart VSCode

**THIS IS REQUIRED!** Close VSCode completely and open it again.

### ✅ Step 7: Verify It Works

1. After restarting, go to **File → Preferences → VSCode Settings → Tools & Integration**
2. Find "azure-devops" in the list
3. **You should see a green dot ✅** = Connected!
4. Click on it to see all 60+ available tools

**No green dot?** See [Troubleshooting](#-troubleshooting)

### 🎉 Step 8: Test It!

1. Open a new chat in VSCode (Ctrl+L)
2. Type: "List my Azure DevOps projects"
3. You should see your projects!

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### 🔍 Quick Diagnostic (Windows)
Double-click `check-env.bat` to automatically check your setup!

### ❌ Common Issues

**"No green dot / Not connected"**
1. Did you restart VSCode after adding the server?
2. Is your path correct in settings? (forward slashes!)
3. Did you run `npm run build`?
4. Is the .env file in the ROOT folder?

**"Authentication failed"**
1. Check your .env file location (must be in root folder!)
2. Is your organization name spelled correctly?
3. Did you copy the ENTIRE token?
4. Has your token expired?

**"Can't find .env file"**
- The .env file should be in the ROOT folder:
  ```
  ADOMCPLocalServer/.env ← HERE!
  NOT in:
  - ADOMCPLocalServer/src/.env ❌
  - ADOMCPLocalServer/dist/.env ❌
  ```

**To verify your .env location:**
1. In VSCode terminal, type: `dir .env` (Windows) or `ls -la .env` (Mac/Linux)
2. You should see the file listed

### 🧪 Test Your Connection
Run this in the VSCode terminal:
```bash
node test-connection.js
```

This will show:
- ✅ If your credentials work
- 📁 What projects you have access to
- ❌ Any connection errors
